# Description
done as a uni project, simple java game. It's very unpolished because it was enough for good grade and i couldn't be bothered to do anything more with it because i wasn't interested in learning and writing Java. When you start game top PLAY button starts game, bottom PLAY button exits, it was a placeholder, as was background to the game but i never got around to finishing it. I've finished this course and i don't plan on developing it any further

## Installation
- make - to compile src files.
- make play - to start game.
